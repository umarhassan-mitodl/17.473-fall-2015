Nuclear Policy Simulation Paper and Exercise
--------------------------------------------

### Paper

The nuclear policy simulation paper should be 5–7 pages, and should answer the following:

*   What should the U.S. policy towards nuclear weapons—nuclear proliferation, nonproliferation, and its own strategy – be?
*   How is your policy recommendation different / similar from what U.S. policies have been in the past, particularly in the Johnson and George W. Bush administrations, as revealed in the memo's below?

While researching and writing your paper, look at the two National Security Memorandum from the Johnson presidency below—these documents are essentially orders from the President to his foreign policy advisors to pursue a particular policy or set of objectives.

Compare with these two official statements by the Bush administration:

Bear in mind that the Johnson documents were top-secret and not for public consumption, whereas the Bush documents were written for widespread public dissemination. How do you think that affected the tone and content of the documents?

### Exercise

You will be split into two groups and asked to craft a policy document laying out what U.S. policy towards nuclear weapons—nuclear proliferation, nonproliferation, and its own strategy – should be.

Your group will present its findings to the President.

The nuclear policy simulation paper and exercise are worth 20% of the final grade.
