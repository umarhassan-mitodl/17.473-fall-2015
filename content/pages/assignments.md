Nuclear Policy Simulation Paper and Exercise
--------------------------------------------

### Paper

The nuclear policy simulation paper should be 5–7 pages, and should answer the following:

*   What should the U.S. policy towards nuclear weapons—nuclear proliferation, nonproliferation, and its own strategy – be?
*   How is your policy recommendation different / similar from what U.S. policies have been in the past, particularly in the Johnson and George W. Bush administrations, as revealed in the memo's below?

While researching and writing your paper, look at the two National Security Memorandum from the Johnson presidency below—these documents are essentially orders from the President to his foreign policy advisors to pursue a particular policy or set of objectives.

[NSAM 320: Task Force on Nuclear Proliferation](https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=459270). November 25, 1964.

[NSAM 335: Preparation of Arms Control Program](https://www.discoverlbj.org/item/nsf-nsam335). June 28, 1965.

Compare with these two official statements by the Bush administration:

[](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/16092.pdf)["National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction." (PDF)](https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/nspd-wmd.pdf) December 2002.

"[V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends with Weapons of Mass Destruction](http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2002/nss5.html)." President Bush, West Point, New York, June 1, 2002.

Bear in mind that the Johnson documents were top-secret and not for public consumption, whereas the Bush documents were written for widespread public dissemination. How do you think that affected the tone and content of the documents?

### Exercise

You will be split into two groups and asked to craft a policy document laying out what U.S. policy towards nuclear weapons—nuclear proliferation, nonproliferation, and its own strategy – should be.

Your group will present its findings to the President.

The nuclear policy simulation paper and exercise are worth 20% of the final grade.
